6.WAP to copy one file into another file.

7.Create 2 files, source1.txt and source2.txt.
Your task is to merge these 2 files in target.txt so that it will contain alternate lines from
source1.txt and source2.txt.Example shown below.

source1.txt = 
C is mother of all languages.
CPP is derived from C.
OOP is started from CPP.

source2.txt =

{
	public:
		char stdname[30];
		int age;
		char hometown[20];
};
You have to write 2 programs in this question.Both programs will access student.txt.
First program will write 3 objects of class Student in student.txt.
Second program will read those objects from file.
Both programs must contain same definition for class Student.
