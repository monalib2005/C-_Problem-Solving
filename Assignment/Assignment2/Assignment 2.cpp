If user enters 20 and 10,then result must be

20 + 10 = 30
20 - 10 = 10
20 * 10 = 200
20 / 10 = 2

Condition for leap year.
-If year is multiple of 100 then it must be multiple of 400.Then it is a leap year.
-If year is not multiple of 100 then it must be multiple of 400.Then it is leap year.
-Otherwise it is not a leap year.
