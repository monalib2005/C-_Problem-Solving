Q.
1.WAP to understand global variable and local variable.Check the following points.
-can we declare two local variables with same name?
-Check if local variable of one function is accessible in another function or not.
-Check if global variables can have same name or not.
-Check if global variable can be initialized at declaration or not.
-change value of global variable from one function,and check if this change
is visible in another function or not.
-try to access gobal variable when local and global have same names.

2.WAP to understand static variable.
-check if static variable can be accessed from other function.
-check if static variable gets initail value again if we call that function again.

3.Write a program to understand pointer arithmetic.
-create an array of 5 integers.
-create an array of 5 characters
-create an array of 5 double values.
-Print addresses and values of each array,check the difference between elements.
-Create three pointers for three arrays.Using these three pointers print all the array elements.
-Using integer pointer of integer array,print square of each element in allay.
-using character pointer of character array,print acii vvalue of each character
-using double pointer for double aray,print values greater than 10.
-scan a number x from user.Using integer pointer search that x in integer array.
-declare a target array of double datatype,using double pointer,copy double array
into target array.

4.WAP to understand concept of function overloading.
Write program for addition of 2 integers,addition of 3 integers,addition of 2 fractions.
Try to generate ambiguity error and solve it using explicit typecasting.

5.WAP to check parameter passing rules.Check following points
-can we mention datatypes for actual parametes?
-can we change number of actual and formal parameters?
-Does any change in formal parameter gets reflected back in actual parameters?
-Can we keep their names same?If their names are same,do they affect each other?
